          <h3>Free School Meals</h3>
          <p>
            Our solution to end world hunger is free school meals. We want global contribution to help struggling countries
            incorporate free meals at their schools. The idea is to create a global fund where every country contributes a fair
            share. The fund is then controlled by a designated team. Each nation chooses one representative to represent their
            country and the team then delegates the fund. By providing free school meals in these countries, it would create a
            better environment for these children. Instead of having to work to feed themselves, it would prevent them from
            dropping
            out of school and it would be giving them a better opportunity of getting an education. By getting an education they
            can
            provide a better future for themselves and their families. The countryâ€™s economy will grow, and they will be
            better equipped to deal with their hunger problems.
